How to Play...

Game Controls:
WASD keys are used to control the frogger character in this game. W & S key are used to control forward and backward respectively, while A & D keys are used to move left and right respectively

Game Operation:
At the very beginning of the game, you should see Frogger positioned at the bottom of the screen. Going from top to bottom, there will be a 5 lane highway, a concrete median, a river and a swampy marsh. Car traffic will go from left to right, but enemies such as the crocodile will be moving in the opposite direction. On the river, the log, crocodiles and turtles will be floating from the right to the left. Use this information to your advantage during later stages where you will have fewer rectangles available to place your frogs.

There are three varieties of logs in Frogger; short, normal and long. As expected, longer logs are ideal because there will be more area for you to hop on. Be aware of the fact that logs are not safe spots to rest. Snakes can instantly appear on any log, at any time, including before, during and directly after you jump.

Turtles are useful 'stepping stones,' but they also come with risks. Some turtles periodically dive beneath the surface of the river, causing Frogger to drown and lose a life. You should observe each new group of turtles in order to determine which ones are divers.

Cars also come in three different versions. Slower cars usually travel in the same lanes, but this is not always the case. There will be more cars that move at a normal speed during the initial stages of Frogger, but as you progress they will become less numerous. Fast cars will re

There is an infinite number of stages on the original Frogger arcade game, but a specific group of four levels are used to establish a repetitive pattern. After you have completed the sixth through the 10th stage, you will learn what to expect on future levels.
